In a response to Catalan's demands, limited autonomy was granted to Catalonia in 1913—abolished in 1920—and granted again in 1932 during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], when the [[Generalitat of Catalonia|Generalitat]], Catalonia's medieval institution of government, was restored. In fact, the constitution of 1931 envisaged a territorial division for all Spain in &quot;autonomous regions&quot;, which was never fully attained—only Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia had approved &quot;[[Statute of Autonomy|Statutes of Autonomy]]&quot;—the process being thwarted by the [[Spanish Civil War]] that broke out in 1936, and the victory of the rebel national forces under [[Francisco Franco]].

When Franco died in 1975, Spain entered into a phase of [[Spanish transition to democracy |transition towards democracy]], and the most difficult task of the newly democratically elected [[Cortes Generales]] (the Spanish Parliament) in 1977 acting as a Constituent Assembly was to transition from a unitary centralized State into a decentralized State&lt;ref name=colomer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54171792.html|title=The Spanish 'state of autonomies': non-institutional federalism.(Special Issue on Politics and Policy in Democratic Spain: No Longer Different?)|last=Colomer|first=Josep M.|work=[[West European Politics]]|date=1 October 1998|accessdate=7 October 2012}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a way that would satisfy the demands of the peripheral nationalists.&lt;ref name=mundo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/especiales/2005/06/espana/estatutos_autonomia/historia.html|title=Café para Todos|work=La España de las Autonomías.

An agreement was made so that the Generalitat would be restored and limited competences would be transfered while the constitution was still being written. Shortly after, the government allowed the creation of &quot;assemblies of members of parliament&quot; integrated by deputies and senators of the different territories of Spain, so that they could constitute &quot;pre-autonomic regimes&quot; for their regions as well. 

The [[Fathers of the Constitution]] had to strike a balance between the opposing views of Spain, on the one hand, the centralist view inherited from Franco's regime,&lt;ref name=colomer/&gt; and on the other hand [[federalism]] and a pluralistic view of Spain as a &quot;nation of nations&quot;;&lt;ref name=sinopsis2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=2&amp;tipo=2|title=Sinópsis artículo 2|work=Constitución española (con sinópsis) |last=Delgado-Ibarren García-Campero|first=Manuel| publisher=[[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of the Deputies]]|date=June 2005|accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; between a uniform decentralization of entities with the same competences and an asymmetrical structure that would distinguish the nationalities. (Peripheral nationalist parties wanted a multinational State with a federal or confederal model, whereas the governing [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Center]] and the [[People's Alliance (Spain)|People's Alliance]] wanted minimum decentralization; the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] was sympathetic to a federal system).&lt;ref name=frans/&gt; In the end, the constitution, published and ratified in 1979, found a balance in recognizing the existence of &quot;nationalities and regions&quot; in Spain, in the &quot;indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation&quot;. While federalism was ruled out, the constitution guaranteed the right to autonomy or self-government of the said &quot;nationalities and regions&quot;, through a process of asymmetric [[devolution]] of power to the &quot;autonomous communities&quot; that were to be created.

===Constitution of 1978===
The starting point in the territorial organization of Spain was the second article of the constitution,&lt;ref name=perez&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/El_Funcionamiento_Del_Estado_Autonomico.html?id=4SnZBb6pIZkC|work=El Funcionamiento del Estado Autonómico|title=Desarrollo y Evolución del Estado Autonómico: El Proceso Constituyente y el Consenso Constitucional|last=Pérez Royo|first=Javier|editor-last=Hernández Lafuente|editor-first=Adolfo|pages=50-67|publisher=Ministerio de Administraciones Públicas|date=December 1999|accessdate=7 October 2012|isbn=8470886908}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reads:

The constitution was rather ambiguous on how this was to take place.&lt;ref name=nunez/&gt;&lt;ref name=colomer/&gt; It does not define, detail, or impose the structure of the State;&lt;ref name=perez/&gt;&lt;ref name=portero/&gt; it does not tell the difference between &quot;nation&quot; and &quot;nationality&quot;; and it does not specify which are the &quot;nationalities&quot; and which are the &quot;regions&quot;, or the territories they comprise.&lt;ref name=perez/&gt;&lt;ref name=clavero&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacioncajamar.es/mediterraneo/revista/me1003.pdf|title=Un balance del Estado de las Autonomías|last=Clavero Arévalo|first=Manuel|work=Colección Mediterráneo Económico, num. 10.|publisher|Fundación Caja Rural Intermediterránea|isbn=4-95531-35-6|date=2006|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than imposing, it ''enables'' a process towards a decentralized structure based on the exercise that these &quot;nationalities and regions&quot; would make of the right to self-government that they were granted.&lt;ref name=perez/&gt; As such, the outcome of this exercise was not predictable&lt;ref name=barberia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2012/09/30/actualidad/1349028022_631925.html|title=¿Reformamos la Constitución?|last=Barbería|first=José Luis|date=30 September 2012|publisher=[[El País]]|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its construction was deliberately open-ended;&lt;ref name=frans&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Regionalism_After_Regionalisation.html?id=u8gZklxHTMUC|title=Regionalism after Regionalisation.

Amsterdam University Press|date=30 June 2006|isbn=9056294288|accesdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the constitution only created a process for an eventual [[devolution]], but it was voluntary in nature: the &quot;nationalities and regions&quot; themselves had the option of choosing to attain self-government or not.&lt;ref name=sinopsis143&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=143&amp;tipo=2|title=Sinópsis artículo 143|work=Constitución española (con sinópsis) |last=Alonso de Antonio|first=José Antonio| publisher=[[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of the Deputies]]|date=June 2003|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to exercise this right, the constitution established an open process whereby the &quot;nationalities and regions&quot; could be constituted as &quot;autonomous communities&quot;. First, it recognized the pre-existing 50 [[provinces of Spain]], a territorial division of the liberal centralizing regime of the 19th century created for purely administrative purposes. (It also recognized the [[municipalities of Spain|municipalities]] that integrated the provinces). These provinces would serve as the building blocks and constituent parts of the autonomous communities. The constitution stipulated that the following could be constituted as autonomous communities:&lt;ref name=article143&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=143&amp;fin=158&amp;tipo=2|title=Título VIII. De la Organización Territorial del Estado. Capítulo tercero. De las Comunidades Autónomas. Artículos 143 a 158|author=Congreso de los Diputados|work=Constitución española|date=1978|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* two or more adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural and economic characteristics,
* insular territories, or
* a single province with a &quot;historical regional identity&quot;.

It also allowed for exceptions to the above criteria, in that the Spanish Parliament could:&lt;ref name=article143/&gt;
* authorize, in the nation's interest, the constitution of an autonomous community even if it was a single province without a historical regional identity; and to
* authorize or grant autonomy to entities or territories that were not provinces.

The constitution also established two &quot;routes&quot; to accede to autonomy. The &quot;fast route&quot; or &quot;fast track&quot;,&lt;ref name=nunez/&gt; also called the &quot;exception&quot;,&lt;ref name=perez/&gt; was established in article 151, and was implicitly reserved for the three &quot;historical nationalities&quot;,&lt;ref name=clavero/&gt;&lt;ref name=sinopsisDT2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=2&amp;tipo=4|title=Sinópsis Disposición Transitoria 2|publisher=[[Congress of Deputies]]|first=José Antonio|last=Alonso de Antonio|date=December 2003|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tanja/&gt; in that the very strict requirements to opt for this route were waived via the second transitory disposition for those territories that had approved a &quot;Statute of Autonomy&quot; during the Second Spanish Republic.&lt;ref name=sinopsisDT2/&gt; (Otherwise, the constitution required the approval of three-fourths of the municipalities involved whose population would sum up at least the majority of the electoral census of each province and the ratification through a [[referendum]] with the affirmative vote of the absolute majority of the electoral census of each province—that is, of all registered citizens, not only of those who would vote). The constitution also explicitly established that the institutional framework for these communities would be a [[parliamentary system]], with a Legislative Assembly elected by [[universal suffrage]], a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] or &quot;council of government&quot;, a president of such a council, elected by the Assembly, and a Supreme Court of Justice. They were also granted a maximum level of devolved competences. 

The &quot;slow route&quot; or &quot;slow track&quot;,&lt;ref name=nunez/&gt; also called the &quot;norm&quot;,&lt;ref name=perez/&gt; was established in article 143. This route could be taken—via the first transitory disposition—by the &quot;pre-autonomic regimes&quot; that had been constituted in 1978, while the constitution was still being drafted, if approved by two-thirds of all municipalities involved whose population would sum up to at least the majority of the electoral census of each province or insular territory. These communities would assume limited competences during a provisional period of 5 years, after which they could assume further competences, upon negotiation with the central government. However, the constitution did not explicitly establish an institutional framework for these communities. They could have established a parliamentary system, or they could have not assumed any legislative powers and simply established mechanisms for the administration of the competences they were granted.&lt;ref name=clavero/&gt;&lt;ref name=perez/&gt;
[[File:Constitucion espanola 1978.JPG|thumb|Spanish Constitution of 1978]]
Once the autonomous communities were created, Article 145 prohibits the &quot;federation of autonomous communities&quot;.  This was understood as any agreement between communities that would produce an alteration to the political and territorial equilibrium that would cause a confrontation between different blocks of communities, an action incompatible with the principle of solidarity and the unity of the nation.&lt;ref name=gonzalez&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congreso.us.es/cidc/Ponencias/federalismo/IgnacioGonzalez.pdf|title=La Prohibición de la Federación entre Territorios Autónomos en el Constitucionalismo Español|last=González García|first=Ignacio|publisher=Congreso Iberoamericano de Derecho Constitucional|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called &quot;additional&quot; and  &quot;transitory&quot; dispositions of the constitution allowed for some exceptions to the above-mentioned framework. In terms of territorial organization, the fifth transitory disposition established that the cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], Spanish exclaves located on the northern coast of [[Africa]], could be constituted as &quot;autonomous communities&quot; if the absolute majority of the members of their city councils would agree on such a motion, and with the approval of the Spanish Parliament, which would exercise its prerogatives to grant autonomy to other entities besides provinces.&lt;ref name=transitorias&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=1&amp;fin=9&amp;tipo=4|title=Disposiciones transitorias|work=Constitución española|author=Congreso de los Diputados|date=1978|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the scope of competences, the first additional disposition recognized the historical rights of the &quot;chartered&quot; territories (in Spanish: ''territorios forales''), namely the Basque-speaking provinces, which were to be updated in accordance to the constitution.&lt;ref name=adicionales&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=1&amp;fin=4&amp;tipo=3|title=Disposiciones transitorias|work=Constitución española|author=Congreso de los Diputados|date=1978|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This recognition would allow them to establish a financial &quot;[[communities of chartered regime|chartered regime]]&quot; whereby they would not only have independence to manage their own finances, like all other communities, but to have their own public financial ministries with the ability to levy and collect all taxes. In the rest of the communities, with a few exceptions, all taxes are collected by the central government and then redistributed.

===The autonomic pacts===
The Statutes of Autonomy of the Basque Country and Catalonia were sanctioned by the Spanish Parliament on 18 December 1979. The position of the party in government, the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Center]], (UCD), was that only the three &quot;historical nationalities&quot; would assume full competences, while the rest would accede to autonomy via article 143, assuming less powers and even not establishing institutions of government. This was firmly opposed by the representatives of [[Andalusia]], who demanded for their region the maximum level of competences granted to the &quot;nationalities&quot;.&lt;ref name=clavero/&gt; After a massive rally in support for autonomy, a referendum was organized for Andalusia to attain autonomy through the very strict requirements of article 151, or the &quot;fast route&quot;—with UCD calling for absention, and the main party in opposition in Parliament, the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) calling for a vote in favor—&lt;ref name=clavero/&gt; but these requirements were not met, in that in only one of the eight provinces, [[province of Almería|Almería]], votes in favor, although the majority, did not amount to half of the electoral census. Yet, the will of the Andalusian people had been clear and unequivocal.&lt;ref name=perez/&gt; After several months of discussion, the then prime minister of Spain, [[Adolfo Suárez]] and the leader of the opposition, [[Felipe González]], reached an agreement to resolve the Andalusian issue, whereby the Parliament approved an amendment to the law that regulated referendums, and used a prerogative of article 144c of the constitution, both actions which combined would allow Andalusia to take the fast route. They also agreed that no other region would take the &quot;fast route&quot;, but all would establish a parliamentary system with all institutions of government.&lt;ref name=clavero/&gt; This opened a phase that was dubbed as ''café para todos'', &quot;coffee for all&quot;.&lt;ref name=tanja/&gt; This agreement was eventually put into writing in July 1981 in what has been called the &quot;first autonomic pacts&quot;,&lt;ref name=nunez&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Spanish_History_since_1808.html?id=ogvsITQ0cmwC|title=The awakening of peripheral nationalisms and the State of the Autonomous Communities|last=Núñez Seixas|first=Xosé M|editor1-last=Álvarez Junco|editor1-first=José|editor2-last=Schubert|editor2-first=Adrian|work=Spanish History since 1808|publisher=Arnold Publishers|year=2000|accessdate=9 October 2008|page=315-330|isbn=0340662298}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in Spanish: ''pactos autonómicos'' or ''acuerdos autónomicos'').

These &quot;autonomic pacts&quot; filled in the gap left by the open character of the constitution.

* they described final outline of the territorial division of Spain, with the specific number and name of the autonomous communities to be created;
* they restricted the &quot;fast-route&quot; to the &quot;historical nationalities&quot; and Andalusia; all the rest had to take the &quot;slow-route&quot;;
* they established that all autonomous communities would have institutions of government within a parliamentary system; and 
* they set up a deadline for all communities to be constituted: 1 February 1983.

In the end, 17 autonomous communities were created:
* Andalusia, and the three &quot;historical nationalities&quot;—the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia—took the &quot;fast-route&quot; and assumed the maximum level of competences immediately; the rest took the &quot;slow route&quot;;
* [[Aragon]], [[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Castile and León]], [[Extremadura]] and the [[Valencian Community]] acceded to autonomy as communities integrated by two or more provinces with common historical, economic and cultural characteristics;
* the [[Balearic Islands]] and the [[Canary Islands]] acceded to autonomy as insular territories, the latter integrated by two provinces;
* [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]] and [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] acceded to autonomy as &quot;uniprovincial&quot; regions with historical idendity;
* [[Navarre]] acceded to autonomy through recognition, update and improvement of its historical &quot;charters&quot; (in Spanish: ''fueros''); and 
* the [[Community of Madrid]] was severed from Castile-La Mancha and constituted as a uniprovincial autonomous community in the nation's interest as the capital of the nation.

Special provisions were made for the Valencian Community and the Canary Islands in that, although they took the &quot;slow route&quot;, through the subsequent approval of specific organic laws, they were to assume the maximum level of competences, since they have started a process towards the &quot;fast route&quot; prior to the approval of the &quot;autonomic pacts&quot;.

[[File:Congreso de los Diputados (España) 14.jpg|thumb|Spanish Parliament, Congress of Deputies]]
During the second half of the 1980s, the central government seemed reluctant to transfer all competences to the &quot;slow route&quot; communities.&lt;ref name=mundo/&gt; After the five years set up by the constitution, all &quot;slow route&quot; communities demanded the maximum transfer guaranteed by the constitution. This led to what has been called the &quot;second autonomic pacts&quot; of 1992, between the then prime minister of Spain [[Felipe González]] from PSOE and the leader of the opposition, [[José María Aznar]] from the newly created [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) successor of the [[People's Alliance (Spain)|People's Alliance party]]. Through these agreements new competences were transfered, with the reforms to many Statutes of Autonomy of the &quot;slow-route&quot; communities with the aim of &quot;equalizing&quot; them to the &quot;fast route&quot; communities.&lt;ref name=mundo/&gt; Finally, in 1995, the cities of Ceuta and Melilla were constituted as &quot;autonomous cities&quot;, with no legislative powers, but with an autonomous assembly not subordinated to any other province or community. 

The creation of the autonomous communities was a diverse process, that started with the constitution, was normalized with the autonomic pacts and was completed with the Statutes of Autonomy.&lt;ref name=perez/&gt; It is, however, an ongoing process; further devolution—or even the return of transferred competences—is always a possibility. This has been evidenced in the 2000s, at the beginning with a wave of approval of new Statutes of Autonomy for many communities, and more recently with many considering the recentralization of some competences in the wake of the economic and financial crisis of 2008. Nonetheless Spain is now a highly decentralized country with a structure unlike any other, similar but not equal to a [[federation]],&lt;ref name=perez/&gt; in what has been called a &quot;State of autonomies&quot;.

===Current state of affairs===
Peripheral nationalism continues to play a key role in Spanish politics. Some peripheral nationalists view that there is a vanishing practical distinction between the terms &quot;nationalities&quot; and &quot;regions&quot;,&lt;ref name=keatings&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/61/8/37890628.pdf |title=Federalism and the Balance of power in European States|first=Michael|last=Keatings  |year=2007 |work=Support for Improvement in Governance and Management |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], Inc.  |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as more competences are transferred to all communities in roughly the same degree and as other communities to chose to identify themselves as &quot;nationalities&quot;.  In fact, it has been argued that the establishment of the State of autonomies&quot; has led to the creation of &quot;new regional identities&quot;,&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=junco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/09/28/opinion/1348855849_016658.html|title=El sueño ilustrado y el Estado-nación|last=Junco|first=José Álvarez|publisher=[[El País]]|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;invented communities&quot;.&lt;ref name=junco/&gt; Many in the Basque Country and Catalonia still view their communities as &quot;nations&quot;, not just &quot;nationalities&quot;, and Spain as a &quot;plurinational State&quot; or a &quot;nation of nations&quot;, and they have made more demands for further devolution.  In 2004, the Basque Parliament approved the [[Ibarretxe Plan]], whereby the Basque Country would approve a new Statute of Autonomy containing key provisions such as shared sovereignty with Spain, full independence of the [[judiciary]] and the right to [[self-determination]], and assuming all competences except that of the [[Spanish nationality law]], defense and monetary policy. The Plan was rejected by the Spanish Parliament in 2005. In 2006, the Catalan Parliament approved a new Statute of Autonomy which included an article that defined Catalonia as a &quot;nation&quot;. The Spanish Parliament made revisions to the final approved version, removing the article, but making a reference in the preamble of the document to the fact that the Catalan Parliament had voted by a large majority to define Catalonia as a nation, but that the constitution recognizes its &quot;national reality&quot; as a &quot;nationality&quot;.&lt;ref name=estatut&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.cat/porteso/estatut/estatut_angles_100506.pdf|title=Organic Law 6/2006 of the 19th July, on the Reform of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia|publisher=[[Generalitat of Catalonia]]|date=2006|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The severe economic crisis in Spain that started in 2008 has produced different reactions in the different communities. One one hand, politicians in some of the communities that are not &quot;nationalities&quot; and governed by the People's Party (PP) are considering a return of some competences to the central government.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/20110729/espana/abcp-varias-autonomias-meditan-devolver-20110729.html|title=Varias autonomías meditan devolver competencias por el bloqueo del gobierno|publisher=[[ABC (Spain)|ABC]]|date=29 July 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in Catalonia, the party in power, [[Convergence and Union]] (CiU), views the &quot;unfairness&quot; of the large fiscal deficit—Catalonia,  being one of the largest net contributors in taxes—as one of the main causes of the strenuous fiscal situation that has allegedly forced the government to enact severe austerity measures and defer payments to workers.&lt;ref name=paisindep&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/09/14/actualidad/1347653709_791863.html|title=Independentismo de corazón y de conveniencia|last=Pérez Oliva|first=Milagros|publisher=[[El País]]|date=16 September 2012|accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, has led many who are not necessarily separatist but who are enraged by the financial deficit to support secession.&lt;ref name=nextstate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21563347|title=Catalonia: Europe's next state.

==Constitutional and statutory framework==
The State of Autonomies, as established in Article 2 of the constitution, has been argued to be based on four principles: willingness to accede to autonomy, unity in diversity, autonomy but not sovereignty of the communities, and solidarity among them all.&lt;ref name=carreras/&gt; The structure of the autonomous communities is determined both by the devolution allowed by the constitution and the competences assumed in their respective Statutes of Autonomy. While the autonomic agreements and other laws have allowed for an &quot;equalization&quot; of all communities, differences still remain. 

===The Statute of Autonomy===
{{main|Statute of Autonomy}}
The Statute of Autonomy is the basic institutional law of the autonomous community or city, recognized by the Spanish constitution in article 147. It is approved by a parliamentary assembly representing the community, and then approved by the [[Cortes Generales]], the Spanish Parliament, through an &quot;Organic Law&quot;, requiring the favorable vote of the absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]]. For communities that acceded to autonomy through the &quot;fast route&quot;, a [[referendum]] is required before it can be sanctioned by the Parliament. The Statutes of Autonomy must contain, at least, the name of the community, its territorial limits, the names, organization and seat of the institutions of government, the competences they assume and the principles for their bilingual policy, if applicable. 

The constitution establishes that all competences not explicitly assumed by the State—the central government—in the constitution, can be assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy; but also, all competences not explicitly assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy are automatically assumed by the State.&lt;ref name=article143/&gt; In case of conflict, the constitution prevails.&lt;ref name=article143/&gt; In case of disagreement, any administration can bring the case before the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].

===Institutional organization===
All autonomous communities have a parliamentary system based on a division of powers comprising:
* a Legislative Assembly, whose members are elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[proportional representation]], in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented;
* a Council of Government, with executive and administrative powers, headed by a &quot;president&quot;, elected by the Legislative Assembly—usually the leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Assembly—and nominated by the [[King of Spain]];
* a Supreme Court of Justice, hierarchically under the Supreme Court of Justice of Spain.

The majority of the communities have approved regional electoral laws within the limits set up by the laws for the entire country. Despite minor differences, all communities use [[proportional representation]] following [[D'Hondt method]]; all members of regional parliaments are elected for four year terms, but the president of the community has the faculty to dissolve the legislature and call for early elections. Nonetheless in all communities, with the exception of the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia and Andalusia, elections are celebrated the last Sunday of May every four years, concurrent with municipal elections in all Spain.&lt;ref name=carreras&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Descentralizaci%C3%B3n_en_Perspectiva_Compar.html?id=zkclm60b_yoC|first=Francesc|last=de Carreras Serra|title=El Estado de las Autonomías en España|work=Descentralización en Perspectiva Comparada: España, Colombia y Brasil|author=Instituto Latinoamericano de Investigaciones Sociales|publisher=Plural Editores|date=2005|accessdate=12 October 2012|isbn=9990563578}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The names of the Council of Government and the Legislative Assembly vary between communities. In some autonomous communities, these institutions are restored historical bodies of government or representation of the previous kingdoms or regional entities within the Spanish crown—like the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]]— while others are entirely new creations. In some, both the executive and the legislature, though constituting two separate institutions, are collectively identified with a single specific name. It should be noted, though, that a specific denomination may not refer to the same branch of government in all communities; for example, &quot;Junta&quot; may refer to the executive office in some communities, to the legislature in others, or to the collective name of all branches of government in others.

Given the ambiguity in the constitution that did not specify which territories were nationalities and which were regions, other territories, besides the implicit three &quot;historical nationalities&quot;, have also chosen to identify themselves as nationalities, in accordance to their historical regional identity, such as Andalusia, Aragon, the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands and the Valencian Community.

The two autonomous cities have more limited competences than autonomous communities, but more than other municipalities. The executive is exercised by a president, which is also the major of the city. In the same way, limited legislative power is vested in a local assembly in which the deputies are also the city councilors.

===Competences===
The autonomic agreements of 1982 and 1992 tried to equalize competences devolved to the 17 autonomous communities,  within the limits of the constitution and the differences guaranteed by it. This has led to an &quot;asymmetrical homogeneity&quot;.&lt;ref name=perez/&gt; In the words of the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] in its ruling of 5 August 1983, the autonomous communities are characterized by their &quot;homogeneity and diversity [...] equal in their subordination to the constitutional order, in the principles of their representation in the Senate, in their legitimation before the Constitutional Court, and in that the differences between the distinct Statutes [of Autonomy] cannot imply economic or social privileges; however, they can be unequal with respect to the process to accede to autonomy and the concrete determination of the autonomic content of their Statute, and therefore, in their scope of competences. The autonomic regime is characterized by an equilibrium between homogeneity and diversity [...] Without the former there will be no unity or integration in the State's ensemble; without the latter, there would not be [a] true plurality and the capacity of self-government.&quot;&lt;ref name=sinopsis137&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=137&amp;tipo=2|title=Sinópsis artículo 137|first=Julio|last=Castelao|work=Constitución española (con sinópsis)| publisher=[[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of the Deputies]]|date=June 2005|accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The asymmetrical devolution is a unique characteristic of the territorial structure of Spain, in that the different constituent territorial entities of the country have different powers. These were based on what has been called in Spanish as ''hechos diferenciales'', &quot;differential facts&quot; or &quot;differential traits&quot;.&lt;ref name=aja&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congreso.us.es/cidc/Ponencias/federalismo/eliseo%20AJA.pdf|title=El Estado Autonómico de España a los 25 años de su constitución|last=Aja|first=Eliseo|publisher=Congreso Ibeoramericano de Derecho Constitucional|date=2003|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expression refers to the idea that some communities have particular traits, with respect to Spain as a whole. In practice these traits are a native &quot;language proper to their own territories&quot; separate from Spanish, a particular financial regime or special civil rights expressed in a code, which generate a distinct political personality.&lt;ref name=aja/&gt; These ''hechos diferenciales'' of their distinct political and historical personality are constitutionally and statutorily (i.e. in their Statutes of Autonomy) recognized in the exceptions granted to some of them and the additional competences they assume.&lt;ref name=aja/&gt;

Competences can be divided into three groups: exclusive to the central State or central government, shared competences, and devolved competences exclusive to the communities. Article 149 states which powers are exclusive to the central government: international relations, defense, administration of justice, commercial, criminal, civil and labor legislation, customs, general finances and State debt, public health, basic legislation and general coordination.&lt;ref name=fiscal/&gt; All autonomous communities have the power to manage their own finances in the way they see fit, and are responsible for the administration of education—school and universities—health and social services and cultural and urban development.&lt;ref name=howmuch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12501023|title=How much is enough? Devolution has been good for Spain, but it may have gone too far|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=6 November 2008|accessdate=14 October 2012}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet there are differences as stipulated in their Statutes and the constitution:&lt;ref name=carreras/&gt; Aragon, the Balearic Islands, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia and the Valencian Community have a regional civil code; the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have their own police corps—the [[Ertzaintza]], the [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] and the [[Policía Foral|Nafarroako Foruzainoga]], respectively—; the Canary Islands have a special financial regime in virtue of its location as an overseas territories, while the Basque Country and Navarre have a distinct financial regime called &quot;chartered regime&quot;; and finally, the Balearic Islands, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, Navarre and the Valencian Community have a co-official language and therefore a distinct linguistic regime.&lt;ref name=carreras/&gt;

===Financial regimes===
{{see also|Communities of chartered regime}}
How the communities are financed has been one of the most contentious aspects in their relationship with the central government.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The constitution gave all communities significant control over spending, but the central government retained effective control of their financing,&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; that is, the central State is still charge of levying and collecting most taxes, which it then redistributes with the aim of producing &quot;fiscal equalization&quot;&lt;ref name=fiscal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Fiscal_Federalism_and_Political_Decentra.html?id=ngoAEwlqMIsC|work=Fiscal Federalism and Political Decentralization: Lessons from Spain, Germany and Canada|editor1-last=Bosch|editor1-first=Núria|editor2-last=Durán|editor2-first=José María|last1=Ruíz-Huerta Carbonell|first1=Jesús|last2=Herrero Alcalde|first2=Ana|title=Fiscal Equalization in Spain|publisher=Edward Elgar Publisher Limited|year=2008|isbn=9781847204677|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to all communities, with the exception of the Basque Country and Navarre. This financial scheme is known as the &quot;common regime&quot;. In essence, &quot;fiscal equalization&quot; implies that richer communities become net contributors to the system, while poorer communities become net recipients. The two largest net contributors to the system are the Balearic Islands and the Community of Madrid, in percentage terms, or the Community of Madrid and Catalonia in absolute terms.&lt;ref name=fiscal/&gt;&lt;ref name=cinco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cincodias.com/articulo/economia/madrid-aporta-estado-doble-cataluna/20071129cdscdieco_1/|title=Madrid aporta al Estado más del doble que Cataluña|publisher=Cinco Días|date=29 November 2007|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Central funding is the main source of revenue for the communities of &quot;common regime&quot;. Redistribution, or transfer payments, is given to the communities of common regime to manage the competences they have assumed and the amount is based on several calculations that take into account, which include a consideration for population, land area, administrative units, dispersal of population, relative poverty, fiscal pressure and insularity.&lt;ref name=tanja/&gt; The central government is committed to returning a specific percentage of taxes to all communities with common regime, within the differences allowed for &quot;fiscal equalization&quot;. The communities of common regime have the ability to add a surcharge to the so-called &quot;ceded taxes&quot;—taxes set at the central level, but collected locally—and they can lower or raise personal income taxes up to a limit.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

The Basque Country and Navarre were granted an exception in the fiscal and financial system through the first additional disposition of the constitution that recognizes their the historical &quot;charters&quot; (in Spanish: ''fueros'')—hence they are known as &quot;[[communities of chartered regime]]&quot; or &quot;foral regime&quot;.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Through their &quot;chartered regime&quot;, these communities are allowed to levy and collect all so-called &quot;contracted taxes&quot;, including income tax and corporate tax, and they have much more flexibility to lower or raise them.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; This &quot;chartered&quot; or &quot;foral&quot; contract entails true financial autonomy.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Since they collect almost all taxes, they send to the central government a pre-arranged amount known as ''cupo'', &quot;quota&quot; or ''aportación'', &quot;contribution&quot;, and the treaty whereby this system is recognized is known as ''concierto'', &quot;treaty&quot;, or ''convenio'', &quot;pact&quot;.&lt;ref name=hacienda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minhap.gob.es/es-ES/Areas%20Tematicas/Financiacion%20Autonomica/Paginas/Regimen%20foral.aspx|title=Régimen foral|author=Ministerio de Hacienda y Administraciones Públicas (Ministry of the Treasury and Public Administrations)|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence they are also said to have ''concierto económico'', an &quot;economic treaty&quot;. Since they collect all taxes themselves and only send a prearranged amount to the central government for the competences exclusive to the State, they do not participate in &quot;fiscal equalization&quot;, in that they do not receive any money back. 

As more competences have been assumed by the autonomous communities, such as social welfare, health and education, public expenditure patterns have seen a shift from the central administration towards the communities since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; In the late 2000s, autonomous communities accounted for 35% of all public expenditure in Spain, a percentage that is even higher than that of states within a federation.&lt;ref name=fiscal/&gt; However, with no legal constraints to balance budgets, and since the cenral government retains control over fiscal revenue in the communities of common regime, these are in a way encouraged to build up debts.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The [[Council on Fiscal and Financial Policy]], which includes representatives of the central government and of the autonomous communities, has become one of the most efficient institutions of coordination in matters of public expenditures and revenue.&lt;ref name=toboso&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-870986501.html|title=Un Primer Análisis Cuantitativo de la Organización Territorial de las Tareas de Gobierno en España, Alemania y Suiza|last=Toboso|first=Fernando|publisher=El Trimestre Económico|date=1 April 2001|accessdate=21 October 2012}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Council several agreements of financing have been agreed, as well as limits to the communities' public debt. The Organic Law of the Financing of Autonomous Communities of 1988 requires that the communities obtain the authorization of the central Ministry of Finance to issue public debt.&lt;ref name=toboso/&gt;

===Linguistic regimes===

Article 3 of the constitution ends up declaring that the &quot;richness of the distinct linguistic modalities of Spain represent a patrimony which will be the object of special respect and protection.&quot;&lt;ref name=third&gt;Third article. {{cite web |url=http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/en/constitucion/Pages/ConstitucionIngles.aspx#i1 |title=Spanish Constitution |author=[[Cortes Generales]] |date=27 December 1978 |work= |publisher=Tribunal Constitucional de España |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must be noted that Spanish remains the only official language of the State; other languages are only co-official with Spanish in the communities that have so regulated. In addition, knowledge of the Spanish language was declared a right and an obligation of all Spaniards.

Spanish legislation, most notably in the Statutes of Autonomy of the bilingual communities, use the term &quot;language proper to a community&quot; (in Spanish: ''lengua propia'', oftentimes translated as &quot;own language&quot;) to refer to a language different from Spanish that originated or had historical roots in that particular territory. The Statutes of Autonomy of the respective autonomous communities have declared [[Basque language|Basque]] the language proper to the Basque Country and Navarre, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] the language proper to Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community—where it is historically, traditionally and officially known as [[Valencian language|Valencian]]—, and [[Galician language|Galician]] to be the language proper to Galicia. There are other protected regional language in other autonomous communities. As a percentage of total population in Spain, Basque is spoken by 2%, Catalan by 17% and Galician by 7% of all Spaniards.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sp.html|title=Spain|work=The CIA World Factbook|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdivisions===
{{see also|provinces of Spain|municipalities of Spain|comarques of Catalonia|vegueries}}

The Spanish constitution recognizes the [[municipalities of Spain|municipalities]] and guarantees their autonomy. Town halls (in Spanish: ''ayuntamientos'') are in charge of the municipalities' government and administration, and they are integrated by a major (in Spanish ''alcalde'') and councilors (in Spanish: ''concejales''), the latter elected by universal sufrage, and the former elected either by the councilor or by sufrage. 

Provinces are groups of municipalities and recognized by the constitution. Their competences and institutions of government vary greatly among communities. In all communities integrated by more than province, provinces are governed by &quot;Provincial Deputations&quot; (in Spanish: ''Diputaciones Provinciales''), with a limited scope administrative competences. In the Basque Country, the provinces, renamed as &quot;[[historical territories]]&quot; (in Spanish: ''territorios históricos'', in Basque: ''lurralde historiko''), are governed by &quot;Chartered Deputations&quot; (in Spanish: ''Diputaciones Forales'', in Basque: ''Foru Aldundi'')—with assume the competences of a provincial deputation as well as the fiscal powers of their &quot;[[communities of chartered regime|chartered regime]]—and by &quot;General Juntas&quot; (in Spanish: ''Juntas Generales'', in Basque: ''Biltzar Nagusiak'')—parliaments with legislative powers. In the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, each major island is governed by an &quot;Insular Council&quot; (in Spanish: ''Consejo Insular'' or ''Cabildo Insular'', in Catalan: ''Consell Insular''). In Catalonia, the &quot;Provincial Deputations&quot; have very little power,&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/64.pdf|title=Regional Government in France and Spain|last1=Smith|first1=Andy|last2=Heywood|first2=Paul|publisher=University College London|date=August 2000|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as other territorial subdivisions have been created. Finally, in those seven autonomous communities formed by a single province, the Provincial Deputations have been replaced by the communities' institutions of government; in fact, the provinces themselves are not only coterminous with the communities, but correspond in essence to the communities themselves. The two-tier territorial organization common to most communities—first province, then municipalities—is therefore non-existent in these &quot;uniprovincial&quot; communities.&lt;ref name=fiscal/&gt;

The constitution also allows the creation of other territorial entities formed by groups of municipalities. As of 2012, the only community that has created such subdivisions with a legal identity and administrative powers is Catalonia: the [[comarques of Catalonia|comarques]] (sing. ''comarca'') are associations of municipalities, and the [[vegueries]] (sing. ''vegueria'') are associations of comarques. Other communities recognize the existence of &quot;historical&quot; comarcas (sing. ''comarca''), with no administrative powers.
